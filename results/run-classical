# Perform inferences with classical DNA substitution models on the short test
# alignments (1k sites), as well as the proper alignments (10k sites). The
# alignments have been created from the counts files using two flavors:
#
# 1. Consensus; for each site, take the nucleotide having highest frequency.
#
# 2. Random; for each site, randomly sample a nucleotide using the counts as
# weights.
#
# We use automated statistical tests to find the most appropriate DNA
# substitution model.
